### Description:

#### Review Data
This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014.

This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).

#### Q&A Data
This dataset contains Questions and Answers data from Amazon, totaling around 1.4 million answered questions.

This dataset can be combined with Amazon product review data, by matching ASINs in the Q/A dataset with ASINs in the review data. The review data also includes product metadata (product titles etc.).
